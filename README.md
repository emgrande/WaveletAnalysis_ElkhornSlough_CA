# WaveletAnalysis_ElkhornSlough_CA
This repository contains the R codes to replicate the figures and analysis of Grande et al., 2022 (“Tidal frequencies and quasiperiodic subsurface water level variations dominate redox dynamics in a salt marsh system”) 

The data to replicate all the analysis of the paper is held in the ESS-Drive repository (Links in the manuscript)

Here I present two examples to carry out the wavelet transform, the global wavelet, calculate the significance level, and calculate the wavelet coherence.
The files with the data for these examples is also in this repository
